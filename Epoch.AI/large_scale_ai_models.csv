Kestrel (DCLM WSD-S Phase): In the first phase, we used the ""DCLM mix"" and WSD-S for about 2.7T tokens. We used 2x TPU v5e-256 coordinated with multislice for this. (0→2.7T tokens)
Ocelot (DCLM WSD Phase): We were given access to a v4-2048 slice and moved to that. To better utilize the hardware, we increased our batch size 50%. We also switched from WSD-S to WSD. We kept the learning rate high through 3.78T tokens.
Jellyfish (First Cooldown): It was time to cooldown as we were starting to run low on DCLM. Following recent work on midtraining (e.g. Olmo 2), we decided to fold in higher quality data during cooldown. (3.78T→4.78T tokens)
Phoenix (Reheated): We had more time for training, so we rapidly rewarmed the model and transitioned our mixture to Nemotron-CC (plus StarCoder Data). (4.78T→11.1T tokens)
Starling (Second Cooldown): Now we were running low on time, so we started another cooldown. We followed a similar process to the first cooldown, but added a few new datasets that we had created and also some that had dropped since our previous attempt.

A core premise of the Marin 8B run was that we didn't fully know the best recipe— so we just started training with what we had, and planned to adapt along the way. Internally, we referred to this as the ""Tootsie"" process, a reference to Tootsie Rolls, which use a ""graining"" process where each day's batch contains a bit of the previous day's, seeding crystallization or something. (We are not food scientists.) This is admittedly a bit of a strained metaphor, but the idea was that we'd keep folding in new data, training techniques, and whatever else as the training process went on. (As it would turn out, dear reader, we would often change more than the data...)

Model Basics
Model Size
We decided to build a roughly 7-8 billion parameter model mostly out of pragmatism: we initially only had reserved capacity to train a model of that size for long enough.

Architecture
We settled on the Llama architecture for the usual reasons: it has been shown to work well, easier to plug into existing inference stacks, no one ever got fired for buying IBM, etc.

A key innovation is our learnable speaker encoder, which extracts timbre features from a reference audio without requiring its transcription. This enables MiniMax-Speech to produce highly expressive speech with timbre consistent with the reference in a zero-shot manner, while also supporting one-shot voice cloning with exceptionally high similarity to the reference voice. In addition, the overall quality of the synthesized audio is enhanced through the proposed Flow-VAE. Our model supports 32 languages and demonstrates excellent performance across multiple objective and subjective evaluations metrics. Notably, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on objective voice cloning metrics (Word Error Rate and Speaker Similarity) and has secured the top position on the public TTS Arena leaderboard. Another key strength of MiniMax-Speech, granted by the robust and disentangled representations from the speaker encoder, is its extensibility without modifying the base model, enabling various applications such as: arbitrary voice emotion control via LoRA; text to voice (T2V) by synthesizing timbre features directly from text description; and professional voice cloning (PVC) by fine-tuning timbre features with additional data.

However, the massive model scale poses significant challenges for the underlying software and hardware systems. In this paper, we aim to uncover a recipe to harness such scale on Ascend NPUs. The key goals are better usage of the computing resources under the dynamic sparse model structures and materializing the expected performance gain on the actual hardware. To select model configurations suitable for Ascend NPUs without repeatedly running the expensive experiments, we leverage simulation to compare the trade-off of various model hyperparameters. This study led to Pangu Ultra MoE, a sparse LLM with 718 billion parameters, and we conducted experiments on the model to verify the simulation results. On the system side, we dig into Expert Parallelism to optimize the communication between NPU devices to reduce the synchronization overhead. We also optimize the memory efficiency within the devices to further reduce the parameter and activation management overhead. In the end, we achieve an MFU of 30.0% when training Pangu Ultra MoE, with performance comparable to that of DeepSeek R1, on 6K Ascend NPUs, and demonstrate that the Ascend system is capable of harnessing all the training stages of the state-of-the-art language models.

Specifically, the advancements of Seedream 3.0 stem from improvements across the entire pipeline, from data construction to model deployment. At the data stratum, we double the dataset using a defect-aware training paradigm and a dual-axis collaborative data-sampling framework. Furthermore, we adopt several effective techniques such as mixed-resolution training, cross-modality RoPE, representation alignment loss, and resolution-aware timestep sampling in the pre-training phase. During the post-training stage, we utilize diversified aesthetic captions in SFT, and a VLM-based reward model with scaling, thereby achieving outputs that well align with human preferences.

Maverick was trained using co-distillation from Llama 4 Behemoth. It isn't 100% clear that all 22T tokens used distillation, but we assume this for the time being.

Estimating training compute from parameters and tokens:
Compute = 6 FLOP per token per parameter * 17B active parameters * 22T tokens = 2.244e24 FLOP
(Implying mean throughput was 262 TFLOPS/GPU, or 13.2% MFU in FP8)


The model card also states that Llama 4 Maverick used 2.38M H100-hours.
The blog post gives a figure of 390 TFLOPS/GPU, but this may have been the utilization rate for Behemoth, or all of the models together. Using this utilization, we have:
Compute = 390 TFLOP/s * 2.38 million hours = 3.342e24 FLOP

However, prevalent models such as Flux, SD3.5 and Midjourney, still grapple with issues like model bias, limited text rendering capabilities, and insufficient understanding of Chinese cultural nuances. To address these limitations, we present Seedream 2.0, a native Chinese-English bilingual image generation foundation model that excels across diverse dimensions, which adeptly manages text prompt in both Chinese and English, supporting bilingual image generation and text rendering. We develop a powerful data system that facilitates knowledge integration, and a caption system that balances the accuracy and richness for image description. Particularly, Seedream is integrated with a self-developed bilingual large language model as a text encoder, allowing it to learn native knowledge directly from massive data. This enable it to generate high-fidelity images with accurate cultural nuances and aesthetic expressions described in either Chinese or English. Beside, Glyph-Aligned ByT5 is applied for flexible character-level text rendering, while a Scaled ROPE generalizes well to untrained resolutions. Multi-phase post-training optimizations, including SFT and RLHF iterations, further improve the overall capability. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that Seedream 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple aspects, including prompt-following, aesthetics, text rendering, and structural correctness. Furthermore, Seedream 2.0 has been optimized through multiple RLHF iterations to closely align its output with human preferences, as revealed by its outstanding ELO score.

OpenAI said GPT-4.5 was a “new order of magnitude in compute”, which they could have meant somewhat loosely. But seems quite likely >1e26 based on that statement, plus 4.5's high inference costs, and <5e26 because OpenAI probably didn’t have a substantially >100k H100 cluster in mid-2024.

These represent two axes of intelligence.

Unsupervised learning increases world model accuracy and intuition. Models like GPT‑3.5, GPT‑4, and GPT‑4.5 advance this paradigm.
Scaling reasoning⁠, on the other hand, teaches models to think and produce a chain of thought before they respond, allowing them to tackle complex STEM or logic problems. Models like OpenAI o1 and OpenAI o3‑mini advance this paradigm.
GPT‑4.5 is an example of scaling unsupervised learning by scaling up compute and data, along with architecture and optimization innovations. GPT‑4.5 was trained on Microsoft Azure AI supercomputers.

However, current open-source models face limitations such as high costs in voice data collection, weakness in dynamic control, and limited intelligence. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Step-Audio, the first production-ready open-source solution. Key contributions include: 1) a 130B-parameter unified speech-text multi-modal model that achieves unified understanding and generation, with the Step-Audio-Chat version open-sourced; 2) a generative speech data engine that establishes an affordable voice cloning framework and produces the open-sourced lightweight Step-Audio-TTS-3B model through distillation; 3) an instruction-driven fine control system enabling dynamic adjustments across dialects, emotions, singing, and RAP; 4) an enhanced cognitive architecture augmented with tool calling and role-playing abilities to manage complex tasks effectively. Based on our new StepEval-Audio-360 evaluation benchmark, Step-Audio achieves state-of-the-art performance in human evaluations, especially in terms of instruction following. On open-source benchmarks like LLaMA Question, shows 9.3% average performance improvement, demonstrating our commitment to advancing the development of open-source multi-modal language technologies.

These are the smartest models we’ve released to date, representing a step change in ChatGPT's capabilities for everyone from curious users to advanced researchers. For the first time, our reasoning models can agentically use and combine every tool within ChatGPT—this includes searching the web, analyzing uploaded files and other data with Python, reasoning deeply about visual inputs, and even generating images. Critically, these models are trained to reason about when and how to use tools to produce detailed and thoughtful answers in the right output formats, typically in under a minute, to solve more complex problems. This allows them to tackle multi-faceted questions more effectively, a step toward a more agentic ChatGPT that can independently execute tasks on your behalf. The combined power of state-of-the-art reasoning with full tool access translates into significantly stronger performance across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks, setting a new standard in both intelligence and usefulness.

OpenAI o3 is our most powerful reasoning model that pushes the frontier across coding, math, science, visual perception, and more. It sets a new SOTA on benchmarks including Codeforces, SWE-bench (without building a custom model-specific scaffold), and MMMU. It’s ideal for complex queries requiring multi-faceted analysis and whose answers may not be immediately obvious. It performs especially strongly at visual tasks like analyzing images, charts, and graphics. In evaluations by external experts, o3 makes 20 percent fewer major errors than OpenAI o1 on difficult, real-world tasks—especially excelling in areas like programming, business/consulting, and creative ideation. Early testers highlighted its analytical rigor as a thought partner and emphasized its ability to generate and critically evaluate novel hypotheses—particularly within biology, math, and engineering contexts.

Previous video generation models often had limited movement and short durations, and is difficult to generate videos with coherent narratives based on text. We propose several designs to address these issues. First, we propose a 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress videos along both spatial and temporal dimensions, to improve both compression rate and video fidelity. Second, to improve the text-video alignment, we propose an expert transformer with the expert adaptive LayerNorm to facilitate the deep fusion between the two modalities. Third, by employing a progressive training and multi-resolution frame pack technique, CogVideoX is adept at producing coherent, long-duration, different shape videos characterized by significant motions. In addition, we develop an effective text-video data processing pipeline that includes various data preprocessing strategies and a video captioning method, greatly contributing to the generation quality and semantic alignment. Results show that CogVideoX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both multiple machine metrics and human evaluations.

This approach allows the model to generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning with human perceptual processes.

The pruning masks are learned by training over 188B tokens, which suggests 6 * 188B * 6.4B = 7.22e21 FLOPs.

Pretraining is then run over 6.3T tokens; however, labels are a convex combination of true labels and the predicted labels from the unpruned 6.4B model.

Finally, there is a 1T ""continuation"" pretraining stage without distillation loss, for 6 * 1T * 2.73B = 1.64e22 FLOP, and a 100B context-lengthening stage for another 6 * 100B * 2.73B = 1.64e21 FLOP

We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The resulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development.",United States of America,,,,16384.0,Open (restricted use),"Llama 3.1 model license:

However, due to commercial interest, the most competitive models like GPT, Gemini, and Claude have been gated behind proprietary interfaces without disclosing the training details. Recently, many institutions have open-sourced several strong LLMs like LLaMA-3, comparable to existing closed-source LLMs. However, only the model's weights are provided with most details (e.g., intermediate checkpoints, pre-training corpus, and training code, etc.) being undisclosed. To improve the transparency of LLMs, the research community has formed to open-source truly open LLMs (e.g., Pythia, Amber, OLMo), where more details (e.g., pre-training corpus and training code) are being provided. These models have greatly advanced the scientific study of these large models including their strengths, weaknesses, biases and risks. However, we observe that the existing truly open LLMs on reasoning, knowledge, and coding tasks are still inferior to existing state-of-the-art LLMs with similar model sizes. To this end, we open-source MAP-Neo, a highly capable and transparent bilingual language model with 7B parameters trained from scratch on 4.5T high-quality tokens. Our MAP-Neo is the first fully open-sourced bilingual LLM with comparable performance compared to existing state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, we open-source all details to reproduce our MAP-Neo, where the cleaned pre-training corpus, data cleaning pipeline, checkpoints, and well-optimized training/evaluation framework are provided. Finally, we hope our MAP-Neo will enhance and strengthen the open research community and inspire more innovations and creativities to facilitate the further improvements of LLMs.","Canada,China,China",,,,512.0,Open source,"Apache 2.0

combining its modalities and is highly responsive
to biological alignment. We have prompted ESM3

proteins. Similarly distant natural fluorescent proteins are separated by over five hundred million

6 * 340B * 9T = 1.8E25

alternatively, can do a hardware estimate with a few extra steps:

According to the technical report, Nemotron-4 340B was trained using up to 6144 H100 GPUs. Helpfully, they also report the model FLOP utilization (MFU), which was 41-42% (Table 2). This is the ratio of the actual output of their GPUs, in FLOP used for training, relative to their theoretical max of 989 teraFLOP/s per GPU. 
Unfortunately, the report omits the last ingredient, which is the duration of the training run. However, in Table 2 they report some relevant data that we can use to infer the training time. 
Nemotron-4 was trained in several stages, but the largest stage used all 6144 GPUs with a batch size of 2304 and an iteration time (time per batch) of 8.0 seconds. This stage involved 7.6T tokens, so it makes up the majority of training. 
A batch size of 2304 means that each batch consists of 2304 sequences, and they report that the sequence length used for training was 4096 tokens. This means that each batch contained 4096 * 2304 = 9,437,184 tokens. 
So, during this stage, it took 8 seconds to train the model on 9.4m tokens. Extrapolating to the entire 9T token dataset, this implies the training run would have taken 7,659,574 seconds, or 89 days. (it actually took longer because they didn't use all their GPUs for the whole run) 
Multiplying 7,659,574 seconds by 41% MFU, 989 peak teraFLOP/s for each H100, and 6144 H100s, we get ~1.9e25 FLOP. This is very close to our first estimate. 
",Unspecified unreleased,"The technical report for the 340B model cites the report for the 15B version (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16819 )

from that paper:

""We train Nemotron-4 15B on a pre-training dataset consisting of 8 trillion tokens. At a high-level,
the data blend is split into three different types of data: English natural language data (70%), multilingual
natural language data (15%), and source-code data (15%).
The English corpus consists of curated documents from a variety of sources and domains including web
documents, news articles, scientific papers, books, etc and the distribution used in our pre-training set is
highlighted in Figure 2. The code and multilingual data consists of a diverse set of natural and programming
languages. We find that appropriately sampling tokens from these languages is key to strong accuracies in
these domains. We share the distributions used for both code and multilingual tokens in our pre-training
dataset in Figure 3 and Figure 4 respectively.
In constructing the pre-training corpus, we remove any possible duplicates via document-level exact and
near-deduplication (Jennings et al., 2023). We additionally applied document-level quality filtering across
our corpus using a language-model based filtering approach similar to (Wenzek et al., 2019) in addition to a

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average.

In particular, we study the importance of various architecture components and data choices. Through careful and comprehensive ablations of the image encoder, the vision language connector, and various pre-training data choices, we identified several crucial design lessons. For example, we demonstrate that for large-scale multimodal pre-training using a careful mix of image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) few-shot results across multiple benchmarks, compared to other published pre-training results. Further, we show that the image encoder together with image resolution and the image token count has substantial impact, while the vision-language connector design is of comparatively negligible importance. By scaling up the presented recipe, we build MM1, a family of multimodal models up to 30B parameters, including both dense models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants, that are SOTA in pre-training metrics and achieve competitive performance after supervised fine-tuning on a range of established multimodal benchmarks.

By giving the model foresight of many frames at a time, we’ve solved a challenging problem of making sure a subject stays the same even when it goes out of view temporarily. Similar to GPT models, Sora uses a transformer architecture, unlocking superior scaling performance. ",United States of America,,,,,Unreleased,,Industry

We address this by training a bespoke image captioner and use it to recaption the training dataset.

In this paper, we are the first to propose a hybrid model, dubbed as Show-1, which marries pixel-based and latent-based VDMs for text-to-video generation. Our model first uses pixel-based VDMs to produce a low-resolution video of strong text-video correlation. After that, we propose a novel expert translation method that employs the latent-based VDMs to further upsample the low-resolution video to high resolution. Compared to latent VDMs, Show-1 can produce high-quality videos of precise text-video alignment; Compared to pixel VDMs, Show-1 is much more efficient (GPU memory usage during inference is 15G vs 72G).

Our key technical contribution is an exploration of the compatibility and the potential for joint optimization of the two types of objectives, which has led to a strategy for training xTrimoPGLM at an unprecedented scale of 100 billion parameters and 1 trillion training tokens. Our extensive experiments reveal that xTrimoPGLM significantly outperforms other advanced baselines in diverse protein understanding tasks (13 out of 15 tasks across four categories) and generates novel protein sequences which are structurally similar to natural ones. Furthermore, using the same xTrimoPGLM framework, we train an antibody-specific model (xTrimoPGLM-Ab) using 1 billion parameters. This model set a new record in predicting antibody naturalness and structures, both essential to the field of antibody-based drug design, and demonstrated a significantly faster inference speed than AlphaFold2.

We find strong evidence in support of this hypothesis across three different experiments, each of which reveal different facets of moral self-correction. We find that the capability for moral self-correction emerges at 22B model parameters, and typically improves with increasing model size and RLHF training. We believe that at this level of scale, language models obtain two capabilities that they can use for moral self-correction: (1) they can follow instructions and (2) they can learn complex normative concepts of harm like stereotyping, bias, and discrimination. As such, they can follow instructions to avoid certain kinds of morally harmful outputs.

We propose a semi-causal language modeling objective to jointly pretrain the interface and the modular encoders. We subsume the advantages and capabilities from both causal and non-causal modeling, thereby combining the best of two worlds. Specifically, the proposed method not only inherits the capabilities of in-context learning and open-ended generation from causal language modeling, but also is conducive to finetuning because of the bidirectional encoders. More importantly, our approach seamlessly unlocks the combinations of the above capabilities, e.g., enabling in-context learning or instruction following with finetuned encoders.

To address this challenge, we introduce the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark (BIG-bench). BIG-bench currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 450 authors across 132 institutions. Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development, and beyond.

We evaluate the behavior of OpenAI's GPT models, Google-internal dense transformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench, across model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters. In addition, a team of human expert raters performed all tasks in order to provide a strong baseline. Findings include: model performance and calibration both improve with scale, but are poor in absolute terms (and when compared with rater performance); performance is remarkably similar across model classes, though with benefits from sparsity; tasks that improve gradually and predictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization component, whereas tasks that exhibit ""breakthrough"" behavior at a critical scale often involve multiple steps or components, or brittle metrics; social bias typically increases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but this can be improved with prompting.",United States of America,,,,,Unreleased,,Industry

To date, there seems to be still no consensus on what the right architecture and pre-training setup should be. This paper presents a unified framework for pre-training models that are universally effective across datasets and setups. We begin by disentangling architectural archetypes with pre-training objectives -- two concepts that are commonly conflated. Next, we present a generalized and unified perspective for self-supervision in NLP and show how different pre-training objectives can be cast as one another and how interpolating between different objectives can be effective. We then propose Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), a pre-training objective that combines diverse pre-training paradigms together. We furthermore introduce a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-training schemes. We conduct extensive ablative experiments to compare multiple pre-training objectives and find that our method pushes the Pareto-frontier by outperforming T5 and/or GPT-like models across multiple diverse setups. Finally, by scaling our model up to 20B parameters, we achieve SOTA performance on 50 well-established supervised NLP tasks ranging from language generation (with automated and human evaluation), language understanding, text classification, question answering, commonsense reasoning, long text reasoning, structured knowledge grounding and information retrieval. Our model also achieve strong results at in-context learning, outperforming 175B GPT-3 on zero-shot SuperGLUE and tripling the performance of T5-XXL on one-shot summarization.

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.",United States of America,,,,10000.0,Unreleased,"https://openai.com/blog/openai-api

This 2.6B parameter neural network is simply trained to minimize perplexity of the next token. We also propose a human evaluation metric called Sensibleness and Specificity Average (SSA), which captures key elements of a human-like multi-turn conversation. Our experiments show strong correlation between perplexity and SSA. The fact that the best perplexity end-to-end trained Meena scores high on SSA (72% on multi-turn evaluation) suggests that a human-level SSA of 86% is potentially within reach if we can better optimize perplexity. Additionally, the full version of Meena (with a filtering mechanism and tuned decoding) scores 79% SSA, 23% higher in absolute SSA than the existing chatbots we evaluated.",United States of America,,,,1024.0,Unreleased,,Industry

See for instance: 
https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphago-zero-starting-scratch

Since AGZ reaches the ELO of AlphaGo Master in about 25-30 days (60-75% of the total training time), I estimate the compute to be around 60-75% that of AGZ.

AGZ had two models, one of which was small and another of which was large. The compute for AGZ is for the large model, which has 40 residual blocks instead of 20.

A second way of looking at this... we believe multiple TPUs were used for training. 29 million games * 211 moves per game on average * 0.8 seconds per move = 4.8952E+09 seconds of player-time across all TPUs.

4.8952E+09 seconds of player-time / (40 days * 24 * 60 * 60 seconds of real time) ~= 1,416 players

4 TPUs per player => 4.8952E+09 * 4 = 1.95808E+10 TPU-seconds
Total compute = 1.95808E+10 TPU-seconds * 92E+12 FLOP/(TPU-second) * 0.4 = 7.2e23 FLOP

So similar to the Cotra and Davidson estimate (within a factor of 2).
