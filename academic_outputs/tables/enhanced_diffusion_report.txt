ENHANCED DIFFUSION ANALYSIS REPORT
=============================================

SAMPLE QUALITY: EXCELLENT
Sample size: 1322 comparable pairs identified
✅ Sample size sufficient for robust statistical inference

DIFFUSION PATTERNS:
  Mean lag: 34.3 months
  Median lag: 35.6 months
  Range: 0.1 - 60.0 months
  Std deviation: 17.4 months
  Coefficient of variation: 0.51
  Size effect: Larger open models take longer
  Similarity effect: More similar models are faster

TEMPORAL TRENDS:
  No significant temporal trend detected

CAUSAL ANALYSIS:
  Overall assessment: Strong causal evidence
  Successful identification strategies: 3
  difference_in_differences_log_parameters: Effect = -2.619 (not significant)
  difference_in_differences_log_params_alt: Effect = -1.170 (not significant)

POLICY IMPLICATIONS:
  ✅ MANAGEABLE: Moderate diffusion speed
  - Current pace allows reasonable exclusivity
  - Traditional incentives may suffice
  - Continue monitoring trends

LIMITATIONS & FUTURE RESEARCH:
  - Model similarity assessment could be refined
  - Additional data collection would improve precision
  - Cross-domain analysis could provide broader insights
